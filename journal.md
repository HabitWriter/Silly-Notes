Got things started with the file structure for the project. Feeling much more confident now on setting up the needed models tomorrow. Got things imported correctly too. Need to make sure to add the .js to the end of things so that way things work. 

Tomorrow's task, set up all the models and relationships through sequelize.

After that we can start on DB seeding.
