# Silly Notes
 An attempt at making my life easier with notes on coding topics.

 ## Thoughts & Obstacles

 Search and Ordering by most recently opened will need to be the last features added (if added at all).
Adding new topics will need to be in the topics dropdown. Probably need that dropdown to be a component of itself that returns the selected topic.
Simpler to keep everything on one page.
Using Redux
Not sure how to use Bootstrap for this layout, will need to figure that out.
I think there will be a lot of complexity to the topics dropdown design, Should allocate time to figuring that out.
Will need to display current topic being filtered.
Separate instance will need to display topic of open subtopic
Need to have buttons accessible on both web and mobile
Separate instance will need to be blank for new subtopic
Responsive header will be a bit of a challenge.
I donâ€™t think I want to use the DB for open/closed subtopics. Just want to use state for that.
Will update Code Example, Notes, and Links onChange.
Possibly need a links data table. Or use something else.
Going to need to figure out the user flow and see if this is something actually possible.
Going to build out the model as if users are involved regardless. Just to futureproof.

## Dev Journal

### 12/5/2023
Got things started with the file structure for the project. Feeling much more confident now on setting up the needed models tomorrow. Got things imported correctly too. Need to make sure to add the .js to the end of things so that way things work. 

Tomorrow's task, set up all the models and relationships through sequelize.

After that we can start on DB seeding.
